# Project: Automated Prediction System

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based backend application designed to automatically fetch, process, and provide product predictions. The system is particularly useful for scenarios involving large datasets. The frontend itÂ´s fully developd using React.

## Features
- **Automated Prediction Fetching**: Fetches and processes predictions periodically (every 3 minutes).
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes a trained model to predict product codes based on descriptions.
- **Data Storage**: Caches predictions in memory for quick retrieval.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/predicciones` - Retrieves the latest predictions.
  - `/api/send-seleccion` - Accepts and processes user selections.
  - `/api/buscar` - Searches products in the CSV database.
  - `/api/getAudio` - Downloads audio files related to predictions.
- **Text Normalization**: Pre-processes input text for consistent predictions.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Ensures cache updates and retrievals are safe in multi-threaded environments.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: Initializes a machine learning model and vectorizer from stored files.
2. **Periodic Updates**: A background thread fetches product data and updates the cache every 3 minutes.
3. **Prediction Logic**: Uses the TF-IDF vectorizer and a trained SGDClassifier to predict product codes based on processed text descriptions.
4. **API Services**: Provides endpoints for predictions, user selections, and data searching.
5. **Text and Image Processing**: Normalizes descriptions and processes image data for base64 encoding.
